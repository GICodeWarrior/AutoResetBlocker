Certain versions of Android are currently vulnerable to a USSD attack.  This
application is intended to block USSD code execution from URLs.
http://gizmodo.com/5946334/samsung-security-bug-can-wipe-out-your-galaxy-phone-updating

The worst known exploit of this vulnerability will factory reset your phone
without confirmation.

The vulnerability is NOT limited to Samsung phones.  All Android phones running
less than Android 4.1.1 are vulnerable until manufacturers/carriers release
updates.

Phones known to have updates available include: Galaxy S3, Galaxy Nexus

Configure and verify it works for you:
1. Try this IMEI test: http://git.io/HtEU4Q
2. Check the box to make "Auto-Reset Blocker" the default action
3. Auto-Reset Blocker will block it and show you the malicious number
4. Dismiss the request
5. Open this safe telephone number test: http://git.io/3LZlrQ
6. Auto-Reset Blocker will show the safe number
7. Touch "Dial"
8. Your normal dialer will open with the safe number

If you have more than one dialer installed (besides this one), step 7 will
first ask you which dialer to use.

If you check the box labelled "Auto-dial when safe", steps 5 and 6 are
eliminated for your next safe number.

Once you make it through the above instructions, you are all set!  If you are
browsing the web on your phone and a website uses a malicious code, Auto-Reset
Blocker will block it and warn you (just like the IMEI test).  Tap the Dismiss
button and go back to your browsing.
