The worst known exploit of this vulnerability will factory reset your phone
without confirmation.

The vulnerability is NOT limited to Samsung phones.  I have positive
confirmation the vulnerability exists on at least these additional phones:
Droid Incredible, ATRIX, Nexus One, One X, Defy

Configure and verify it works for you:
1. Try this IMEI test: http://jsfiddle.net/kKFn8/
2. Check the box to make "Auto-reset blocker" the default action
3. Auto-reset blocker will show you the malicious number
4. Open this safe telephone number test: http://jsfiddle.net/tLHpw/
5. Auto-reset blocker will show the safe number
6. Touch "Dial"
7. Your normal dialer will open with the safe number

If you have more than one dialer installed (besides this one), step 7 will
first ask you which dialer to use.

If you check the box labelled "Auto-dial when safe", steps 5 and 6 are
eliminated.
